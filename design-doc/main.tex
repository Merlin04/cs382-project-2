    \section{Plan}
    We plan to check in next week to make sure everything is being worked on.
    We've already made good progress; we will likely finish up the design document next week.
    Note that we weren't really given enough time to start on the breadth-first search section, due to the canceled classes and my own (Dale) slow progress on the map class.
